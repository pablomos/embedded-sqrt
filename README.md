### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains open-source computational solutions to math problems. To start, I have the problem of evaluating the result of the expression:

sqrt( 1 + 2 sqrt( 1 + 3 sqrt( 1 + 4 sqrt(...) ) ) )

### How do I get set up? ###

Clone the repository, then simply execute:

python square_square_root.py

for the result of the above expression.

This package is very minimal and requires Python and Numpy to run.

### Contribution guidelines ###
